## META
### First Principles
* Understand the root cause before changing code.
* Fix causes, not symptoms.
* Follow existing architecture and conventions unless they conflict with correctness.
* Prefer the simplest solution that fully solves the problem.
### Execution
* Default to action on low-risk, reversible changes.
* Avoid unnecessary confirmations.
* Stop only for true human-gated decisions.
* Do not expand scope without justification.
### Verification
* Execution is the source of truth.
* Verify through Type Check, Lint, Tests, and Build whenever applicable.
* Never claim verification that was not executed.
* Tag conclusions as: Executed, Inspected, or Assumed.
### Refactoring
* Refactor adjacent code only when it directly supports the current task.
### Push Back
* If a request conflicts with correctness, security, or maintainability, explain the concern and propose a better alternative.
## General Rules
Before making changes:
1. Understand the existing implementation.
2. Reuse existing patterns.
3. Prefer modifying existing files over creating new ones.
4. Keep changes minimal and focused.
5. Avoid unnecessary abstractions.
Prefer:
* Simple solutions
* Clear naming
* Focused changes
Avoid:
* Over-engineering
* Premature optimization
* Dead code
## Naming Rules
### General
* Use clear, specific, business-oriented names.
* Prefer business meaning over implementation details.
* Avoid generic names such as: data, item, result, temp, value.
* Avoid technical placeholder names such as: processedData, transformedData, parsedResponse, formattedResult, normalizedData.
### Variables
* Use camelCase.
* Boolean variables should start with: is, has, can, should.
* Arrays should use plural names.
### Functions
* Use camelCase.
* Function names should describe business behavior.
* Functions should represent business logic, not simple data reshaping.
* Prefer direct object construction for one-time transformations.
Do NOT use:
* normalize*
* parse*
* transform*
* convert*
* format*
* build*
* map*
when they only perform field mapping, object reshaping, or property copying.
### Types
* Use PascalCase.
* Avoid prefixes such as I*and T*.
### Components
* Use PascalCase.
### Composables
* Must start with use.
### Files
* Vue Components: PascalCase
* Other files: kebab-case
## AI Modification Comments
* When AI changes logic, behavior, or structure, add a concise comment nearby.
* Explain why the change exists.
* Keep comments short.
* Do not comment every line.
* Do not add meaningless comments.
Example:
```ts
// AI modified: added fallback handling for empty user names.
```
## TypeScript
* Use strict typing.
* Avoid any.
* Prefer explicit types.
## Dependencies & Files
* Check existing dependencies before adding new ones.
* Prefer built-in platform APIs.
* Prefer modifying existing files.
* Create new files only when responsibility separation is clearly justified.
## High-Risk Changes
Require confirmation before:
* Database schema changes
* Production data modifications
* Public API changes
* Authentication or authorization changes
* Large cross-module refactors
* Irreversible operations
## Forbidden
Do NOT:
* Rewrite large areas unnecessarily.
* Introduce breaking changes without justification.
* Disable lint rules.
* Ignore TypeScript errors.
* Use any as a shortcut.
* Change unrelated files.
* Create helper functions solely for field mapping.
* Use normalize as a method, variable, file, or type name.
* Add meaningless AI comments.
## Completion Criteria
* Implementation is finished.
* Relevant verification is completed.
* Risks and assumptions are reported.
* Scope remains controlled.
* Changes remain maintainable.

<!--VITE PLUS START-->

## Using Vite+, the Unified Toolchain for the Web

This project is using Vite+, a unified toolchain built on top of Vite, Rolldown, Vitest, tsdown, and Vite Task. Vite+ wraps runtime management, package management, and frontend tooling in a single global CLI called `vp`. Vite+ is distinct from Vite, and it invokes Vite through `vp dev` and `vp build`. Run `vp help` to print a list of commands and `vp <command> --help` for information about a specific command.

Docs are local at `node_modules/vite-plus/docs` or online at https://viteplus.dev/guide/.

## Review Checklist

- [ ] Run `vp install` after pulling remote changes and before getting started.
- [ ] Run `pnpm lint`, `pnpm type-check`, and `vp test` to lint, type check, and test changes.
- [ ] Check if there are `vite.config.ts` tasks or `package.json` scripts necessary for validation, run via `vp run <script>`.
- [ ] If setup, runtime, or package-manager behavior looks wrong, run `vp env doctor` and include its output when asking for help.
